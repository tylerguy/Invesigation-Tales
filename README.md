# The-Investigation-Tales

A Game Design Project

# Story
You are an investigator, tasked with investigating the death of the person who died in several locations,but a ghost follows you messing with your investigation. The ghost can either give you clues, as well as mislead you.

# Game Mechanics

The game will have a flashlight mechanic, for use in dark areas. This can only be used in bursts, with a cooldown between each use, so the player will have memorise the route they must take.
The Ghost will have some basic AI, with the ability to knock over objects in order to reveal clues, with each object having the chance of not showing a clue, showing a helpful clue, or a misleading clue.
The player will solve puzzles by going to a specific room after finding a clue, or moving an object from one room to another.

# Gameplay Summary

The Main goal of the game is to look for clues and move the objects in the house, which will reveal stuff about how the ghost died. 

The game will feature you as the player, and you are able to move objects and interact with objects to investigate. The player will have to use a torch to navigate dark areas, but also to turn on the generator at the start of the game.

The ghost at random points can interact with objects while the player isnâ€™t looking, which may help the player find the necessary rooms to find the clues in. This could be done in the form of a picture taken in a specific room, or the object that has been moved being placed in another room. Sometimes clues could also be misleading, meaning the player has to have a good knowledge of the map, or gain a sense on whether or not the clue could be misleading to the story.
